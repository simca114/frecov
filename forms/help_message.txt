Usage: frecov FILEPATH

Scans available snapshots for FILEPATH. FILEPATH can point to either a file name or a directory name.
If at least one version is found, a menu will display prompting you for a choice.
A copy of the selected file and version will be made and placed into the directory 'backup_recovery',
which will be created in your home directory.

If no version of FILEPATH is found, it does not exist in our snapshots. Possible reasons for this
could be because FILEPATH was created within the last hour or FILEPATH has not existed in your home
directory for more than 15 days.

FILEPATH is a string with the following formats:
    - Absolute path using default path ( /home/$user/$homedir/$path_to_file
    EXAMPLE: /home/%s/ubuntu/$path_to_file

    - Absolute path using /u symlink (points to homedir of operating system the computer you are using is loaded with)
    EXAMPLE: /u/%s/path_to_file

    - Relative path from homedir (points to homedir of operating system the computer you are using is loaded with)
    EXAMPLE: ~/path_to_file
