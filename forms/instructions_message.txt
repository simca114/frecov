The file and version you have chosen have been copied into a directory called
"backup_recovery" which has been placed in your home directory.

The directory chosen depends on the input path you provided. If an absolute
path with the format "/home/$USER/$OS/" was given, then the home directory
chosen will be the specified $OS. Otherwise, it will be placed in the
home directory of the operating system of the machine currently logged in.

Inside "backup_recovery", if it doesnt already exist a directory with the
name of the selected timestamp will be created. The given file will be copied
into there, overwriting an existing file if it exists.

YOU SHOULD NOT WORK INSIDE THIS DIRECTORY!

Copy the retrieved file(s) into a different location inside your home
directory before working with it.
